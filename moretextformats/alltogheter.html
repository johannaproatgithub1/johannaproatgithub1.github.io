    <b> <i>What is JavaScript? </i></b>
<mark>JavaScript</mark> is a powerful programming language originally created by Netscape, and is supported by Netscape 2.0 and higher, and Explorer 4.0 and higher.
It is primarily used to add interactivity and multimedia to web pages. Beside the name, JavaScript has nothing to do with Java programming language.
The fact that the names are similar to each other has led to some confusion.

<mark><dfn>JavaScript</dfn></mark> is a powerful programming language originally created by Netscape, and is supported by Netscape 2.0 and higher, and Explorer 4.0 and higher. <br>
It is primarily used to add interactivity and multimedia to web pages. <del>Beside the name, JavaScript has nothing to do with Java programming language.</del> <br>
<ins>The fact that the names are similar to each other has led to some confusion. </ins><br>

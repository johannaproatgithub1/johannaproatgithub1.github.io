There's much written on www about history of the Internet.For example, about the first graphical Internet browser on the web - Mosaic. 
Mosaic is the first widely-used graphical World Wide Web browser, released on April 22, 1993 by the NCSA with the help of Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina. A big competitor to Mosaic was Netscape, which was released a year later. Today's Internet browsers we use today (e.g., Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc.), got their inspiration from the Mosaic browser.
